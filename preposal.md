## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- A interactive code that uttulizes shapes in terminal, animated to "look" 3D
- Small Website
- Mod for Alice: Madness Returns, that FIXES the windows box to allow it to be properly minimized, closed, and fullscreen'd on Windows 11 (very very niche and personal problem I have)
- Mod for the original Super Mario Brothers

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I do plan to colaborate, but at this time, I do not have any names

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How aggressive are the progress reports, what are some more examples of the thresholds you have to meet if you want to personally skip the final exam. Any extra credit on assignment (beside this one)

And additonally, with permission of course, can those projects be shown?
